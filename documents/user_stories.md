Michelle is a research scientist. Michelle wants to tracks particles in her image data. 
She wants a fast and effective means to track, process, analyze, and store her data. Michelle has 
particle tracking experience and values an open source code that allows for edits.

Lucia is a teaching scientist. Lucia wants to show her class the wonders of image analysis.
She wants a easy to follow user interface. Also, she values an ability to view the progression
of her video analysis. Lucia has students interested in exploring in the future and wants an easy 
way to send it to her students. 

Andrew is a student researcher. Andrew was told to use a particle tracking software to find information
about his experimental videos. He wants an easy to use interface and an effective method to track particles. 
Andrew has very limited experience in particle tracking so he values proper documentation and easy to follow 
diagrams. 

Helena is a student who would like to use tracking code for personal use. She has videos and wants to find
an objects placement throughout the images. Helena wants an easy to use interface that will show her where 
her object is throughout the video. Helena has no particle tracking experience so an easy to follow GUI and
proper documentation is desired.

Doug is an unskilled professional who is interested in trying some new side projects. He wants to be able to 
track objects in everyday life. He wants a well documented and explanatory GUI that can help him learn about
particle tracking. Doug has no experience in  particle tracking so he wants proper documentation and an easy 
to use interface.
