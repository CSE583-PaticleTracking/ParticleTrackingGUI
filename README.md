# ParticleTrackingGUI

### Project Goals
Create a Python GUI for tracking particle trajectories from images. After tracking, the user can 
export desired data and statistics. This GUI can be used for both personal/research purposes.

### Docs
This folder contains example use cases, components, and a diagram to explain the GUI's operation.
There is a technology review that explains the group's thoughts on choosing Streamlit to help with
GUI construction. 

### Examples
There are examples available explaining the use and final results of the GUI.
