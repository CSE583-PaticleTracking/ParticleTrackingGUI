## Use Cases

- Import data with an appropriate data type (jpeg, csv) to the code
    - Convert each data type to a specific data structure
    - Our algorithm will work on that particular algorithm
- Define initial parameters for tracking and define parameters for statistics
- Tracking (Main use case)
- Statistic Anaylsis (User has done their own tracking and wants to do some anaysis on that data)
- Export data to the user
- Enable users to search and filter data in the software.
- Display interactive visualizations and reports.
- Analyze the behavior of nanoparticles in a laboratory experiment.
- Monitor the movement of cells in a biological study.
- Track the motion of vehicles or pedestrians in a traffic simulation.
- Study the flow of fluids in an physical or industrial process.
- Analyze wind patterns and turbulence in meteorology.
- Study fluid flow in engineering and aerodynamics.
- Evaluate vector field data in scientific simulations.
- Identify objects throughout a video.
- Visualize and exploring complex data distributions in data analysis.
- Export data to Excel or csv for further analysis.
- Generating figures for presentations or publishing.
