## USE CASES

- Import data with an appropriate data type (jpeg, csv) to the code
    - Convert each data type to a specific data structure
    - Our algorithm will work on that particular algorithm
- Define initial parameters for tracking and define parameters for statistics
- Tracking (Main use case)
- Statistic Anaylsis (Use has done his own tracking, he wants to to do some anaysis on that data)
- Export data to the user
- Enable users to search and filter data in the software.
- Display interactive visualizations and reports.
- Analyze the behavior of nanoparticles in a laboratory experiment.
- Monitor the movement of cells in a biological study.
- Track the motion of vehicles or pedestrians in a traffic simulation.
- Study the flow of fluids in an physical or industrial process.
