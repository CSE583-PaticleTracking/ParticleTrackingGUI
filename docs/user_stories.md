### Example User Stories
Michelle is a research scientist. Michelle wants to tracks particles in her image data. 
She wants a fast and effective means to track, process, analyze, and store her data. Michelle has 
particle tracking experience and values an open source code that allows for edits.

Lucia is a teaching scientist. Lucia wants to show her class the wonders of image analysis.
She wants a easy to follow user interface. Also, she values an ability to view the progression
of her video analysis. Lucia has students interested in exploring in the future and wants an easy 
way to send it to her students. 

Andrew is a student researcher. Andrew was told to use a particle tracking software to find information
about his experimental videos. He wants an easy to use interface and an effective method to track particles. 
Andrew has very limited experience in particle tracking so he values proper documentation and easy to follow 
diagrams. 

Helena is a student who would like to use tracking code for personal use. She has videos and wants to find
an objects placement throughout the images. Helena wants an easy to use interface that will show her where 
her object is throughout the video. Helena has no particle tracking experience so an easy to follow GUI and
proper documentation is desired.

Doug is an unskilled professional who is interested in trying some new side projects. He wants to be able to 
track objects in everyday life. He wants a well documented and explanatory GUI that can help him learn about
particle tracking. Doug has no experience in  particle tracking so he wants proper documentation and an easy 
to use interface. 

Galen is a professional researcher. Galen has a example videos of a busy intersection and would like to find
how many pedestrians and cars pass through it. He wants a method to not only track the objects but also
export specific data to create a traffic model of the intersection. Galen has limited experience tracking 
so he needs an well documented and easy to use software. 

Aaron is a scientist who studies fluid mechanics. Aaron has videos with tracer particles in a fluid and wants
to find characteristics of the flow. He needs a way to track these tracer particles in his flow to estimate 
fluid velocity. Aaron has some particle tracking experience, so he wants an open source code and an easy to
use GUI.

Mia is a student researcher in biology. Mia has some tracking data from her experiments. She wants to present 
her data, but she needs to format her data and create good figures. Despite her previous tracking experience, 
she needs an easy to use interface. Also, a well documented GUI that guides her through uploading her 
data and creating plots.

Ethan is a meterologist. Ethan has a csv file containing data for local wind patterns. He wants to analyze 
the data he has to find mean wind speeds and directions. He needs to use vector analysis on his data set. 
He has limited vector analysis experience, so he wants an easy to use interface that clearly shows 
inputs and outputs.
